A3 Definition: “The A3 report is a visual manifestation of a problem-solving thought process involving continual dialogue between the owner of an issue and others in an organization.  It is a foundational management process that enables and encourages learning through the scientific method. A3 reports should become a standardized form of currency for problem-solving, dialogue, and decision-making in your organization creating an organization of scientists who continually improve operations and results through constant learning from the work at hand.” “The most fundamental use of the A3 is as a simple problem-solving tool. But the underlying principles and practices can be applied in any organizational settings. Given that the first use of the A3 as a tool is to standardize a methodology to understand and respond to problems, A3s encourage root cause analysis, reveals processes, and represents goals and action plans in a format that triggers conversation and learning.” The four stages of an A3 Project: 1. Define the Dent, 2. Determine Root Cause(s), 3. Determine Root Cause Solutions, 4.

It is a foundational management process that enables and encourages learning through the scientific method. A3 reports should become a standardized form of currency for problem-solving, dialogue, and decision-making in your organization creating an organization of scientists who continually improve operations and results through constant learning from the work at hand.” “The most fundamental use of the A3 is as a simple problem-solving tool. But the underlying principles and practices can be applied in any organizational settings. Given that the first use of the A3 as a tool is to standardize a methodology to understand and respond to problems, A3s encourage root cause analysis, reveals processes, and represents goals and action plans in a format that triggers conversation and learning.” The four stages of an A3 Project: 1.
